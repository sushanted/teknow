Good start, concepts:

https://medium.com/inspiredbrilliance/kafka-basics-and-core-concepts-5fd7a68c3193

Parameters:

1. No. of nodes in the cluster
2. No. of partitions
3. No. of replicas 
4. No. of consumers

No. of partitions can be more than no. of nodes (brokers).

Consumer style : 
1. Every consumer consumes every event
2. Consumer group : Every consumer in a group consumes from a single partition, where every partition receives a hashed value, e.g. if there are 1000 customers 
having customerId and CustID, it can be hashed into N number of partitions and N consumers from the consumer group now can consume messages. One customer's 
events will always be processed by a single consumer and the order in which events were pushed for that customer would always be maintained by kafka.
